## Welcome to Blind Mentors

Blind Mentors is a mentorship community on Discord created after seeing a set of discussions on [Blind](https://www.teamblind.com/).  You can join the Blind Mentors group through [this invite link](https://discord.gg/93VAvPRmPu).

## Some simple rules

1. The community is founded on mutual respect and interest in helping others.  Disrespect, rudeness, will not be tolerated and will result in kicks or bans by the mods.
2. Mentorship is an intently personal relationship, and violating that privacy is not okay.
3. See rule #1.

## How it works

We've got a set of roles on the server
- Mentors - people who are willing to Mentor
  - **Mentor** - You are mentoring people but not necessarily looking for new Mentees 
  - **Mentor L4Mentee** - You are open to being mentoring someone if a match is good. 
- Mentee - people looking for mentorship
  - **Mentee** - You currently being mentored, but don't need more support
  - **Mentee L4Mentor** - You are looking for more mentoring support.
- Matchers - These are trusted members that will help connect Mentees to Mentors. Don't be surprised if some one reaches out to you if you are a member of **Mentee L4Mentor**.  You should be able to trust these people with enought to connect you with a Mentor.  Matchers have a ***Goal Zero*** for L4Mentor or L4Mentee roles.
- Mod - A moderator.  They are the rule enforcers, they will use their judgement to enforce the rules.
- Lurker - A general member of the community.  Expect to see them in the different topical rooms.

## Some simple best practices
- Mentorship is built on trust.  As such there is no heirarchy other than a professional relationship between two people.  
It helps to share stories and personal experiences to help cement those relationships.
- Mentorship is built on communication.  Chat is good, but at the right time moving to voice of video is more important.
- Mentorship is built on build history.  Keep a log of the structured discussions and calls to help form that history.  It's very important if you have mutliple mentoring relationships active at any time. 
- Mentorship is built on structure and consistency.   Find a cadence for focused discussions works best, bi-weekly or monthly structured meetings will help allow time for the advice/feedback to be put in practice.
- Mentorship is built on advice, not direction.  The mentee has a situation, the mentor tries to provide insight, understanding or clarity on that situation.  The mentee still is responsible for their own decisions.  
- Mentorship is a long haul relationship.  Strong mentoring relationships are like fine wine, they improve with age and cultivation.

## Some Common Questions/Concerns

**Why would a Mentor care about me?** Mentors on Blind Mentors have *selected to be involved as a mentor*, they have chosen to put themselves in a situation where they can care for and help the community.  Don't project yourself onto mentors.

**I feel guilty asking my Mentor for help, is it okay to ask?** Again, mentors have chosen to be involved.  The mentor/mentee should negotiate the type/method/frequency of communication and stick to it.  As a relationship, discussions on boundaries are important.

**It's pointless having a mentor outside my company, why bother?** Mentors provide guidance, interpretation, and advice based on the information you give them.  They won't be in the room when you take action, but they can help provide clarity.  The benefit of a mentor outside your company is that they can provide the objective view based on the data you give.
